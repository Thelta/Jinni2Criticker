# Jinni2Criticker

Remember that time Jinni closed down for users because they got enough data.Well, at least they sent an email containing
all your info.However saving all hundreds movies to another service by hand would be stupid.Well, this is for people who chose 
Criticker to save all movies they watched.This bot opens *Chrome* and saves for you instead.

#Usage
* Download [Helium] (http://heliumhq.com/download) version of your OS and Python.Put it to your Python libs.
* Open .xls file Jinni sent you.Copy all of it and covert it to JSON.Then assign JSON to movieString variable.
* Run command line with
```
py click.py -username YOURCRITICKERUSERNAME -password YOURPASSWORD
```
then it will start to save.

#Problems
Because of Helium's 30 day trial, I couldn't fix them however they aren't too much big problem.
There will be some movies that aren't saved.Thisis because either movie's first release date isn't same as  US theater release date
or movie's name is different then IMDB name.
